* **Development:**  The component should be built following best practices for React development.
* **Resources:** You are permitted to utilize Google and ChatGPT for assistance during the development process.

**Additional Notes:**

* This document serves as a starting point for your implementation. Feel free to modify it to fit your specific needs.
* Ensure proper indentation and spacing are applied throughout your code for improved readability.
* Conduct thorough testing of the input component to verify its functionality as expected.
